# JKL_Fitbuddy
The goal of this webapplication is to create a platform where sport enthusiasts can meet with others very easy.
From our own experiences we know that it can be difficult to find a suitable sport buddy or just some hobby sport people. With this application, we created a place to share sport with different people without loosing our flexibility or being bound to another person.
