# JKL_Fitbuddy
The goal of this webapplication is to create a platform where sport enthusiasts can meet with others very easy.
From our own experiences we know that it can be difficult to find a suitable sport buddy or just some hobby sport people. With this application, we created a place to share sport with different people without loosing our flexibility or being bound to another person.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a environment that can handle sbt projects. We recommend using Intelij.
You also need to have sbt installed to run the application.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your preferred folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/enjoymrban/JKL_Fitbuddy
```
You also need to have the following system environment variable set:
```
SYSTEMENVIROMENTVARIABLE
```

Now import the project to your enviroment. 
To start the app just run:

```
sbt run
```

The app should now be available on: http://localhost:9000
